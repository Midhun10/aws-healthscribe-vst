Could you straighten your leg for me, please? Could you just walk a few steps for me so I can have a look? Stephen. So, based on what I've seen and what you've told me, I think we might be looking here at a Baker cyst. It's a fluid filled sac behind your knee. It often causes a bulge and feeling of tightness. It's also called a Popliteal cyst.",

You're going to need to rest your leg whenever possible. Apply ice to the knee. I recommend using a compression wrap on the knee to help reduce swelling and elevate your knee while resting. Try to keep it above your heart level, when possible if you experience any pain, then you can take an over the counter medication like Ibuprofen. Once we get those tests done, we'll know more about the immediate effects. ",
